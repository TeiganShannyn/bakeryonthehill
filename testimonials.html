        <p class="quote">This is the best bakery I've ever been to! Period!</p>
        <p class="quote">When I was a child, my grandmother made me cookies whenever I got A's on my report card. I am beginning to think she stole the recipe from "Bakery on the Hill". They're THAT good!</p>
        <p class="quote">Bakery on the Hill did the cake for my son's wedding. We had a budget and they delivered on time, and went above and beyond! I hope more of my kids get married just so we can order cakes from here!</p>
        <p class="quote">These cookies take me back to my childhood.</p>
